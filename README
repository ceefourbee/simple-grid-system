# Simple grid layout

A simple layout for setting a base grid within the browser (obviously).

Tested in:

* Safari
* Chrome
* Firefox
* IE 7 - 8

Blates needs some more testing.

A JS polyfill is required in later versions of IE because it sucks. This is sorted with the help of modernizr and jQuery, which don't suck.
